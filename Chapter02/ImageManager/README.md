# Image Manager GUI

## Chapter 2 – Building the Foundation for GUIs

This repository accompanies **Building Custom UIs with PyQt** by Joshua Willman (Packt Publishing, 2021).

## Purpose

This GUI serves as an example of how to structure the files and folders for PyQt applications, how to build custom dialogs, save user settings, and use QSettings to save application/system settings. 

## To Run the Application

Open a terminal, navigate to the root directory, and run:
```
$ python3 main.py
```
**NOTE**: For Windows use *python* instead of *python3*.
