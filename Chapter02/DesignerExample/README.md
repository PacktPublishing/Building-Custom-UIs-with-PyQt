# Qt Designer Exampler GUI

## Chapter 2 – Building the Foundation for GUIs

This repository accompanies **Building Custom UIs with PyQt** by Joshua Willman (Packt Publishing, 2021).

## Purpose

This GUI serves as an example of how to structure the files and folders for PyQt applications when using Qt Designer and Qt's XML .ui files. The interface is a simple one that also shows:
- how to set up a main window when using .ui files
- how to use signals and slots to open a basic dialog when using .ui files

Refer the Chapter 2 in **Building Custom UIs with PyQt** for more information about file structuring and how to use the .ui files and pyuic6.

## To Run the Application

Open a terminal, navigate to the root directory, and run:
```
$ python3 main.py
```
**NOTE**: For Windows use *python* instead of *python3*.
